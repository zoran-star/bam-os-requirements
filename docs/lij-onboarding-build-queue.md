# San Jose (Lij) onboarding: build queue

Live queue of everything the San Jose onboarding surfaces. Onboarding spans days and sessions, so this file is the memory, not the session task list.

**Started 2026-07-25.**

Team roster, spawn prompts and gate mechanics: [lij-onboarding-team-playbook.md](lij-onboarding-team-playbook.md).

## The triage rule

Every gap found during onboarding gets exactly one severity BEFORE anyone proposes work:

| Severity | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **BLOCKER** | San Jose cannot onboard correctly, or GTA content leaks to SJ leads | Build now |
| **FRICTION** | SJ can onboard, but a human does something manual or ugly | Queue, batch later |
| **SCALE** | Only bites at academy #3 or later | Backlog note only |

Without this, every find feels urgent and the academy never actually gets onboarded.

## The guardrail on every fix

Sales systems are **shared**. Never fork one academy's structure. If one client needs X, either every academy gets X, or X is a runtime fact (domain, owner, program names, prices, age ranges, location). An `if academy == gta` branch is always the wrong answer.

## How work moves

```
gap found -> triage -> [BLOCKER only] -> planner (mockup + diagram)
  -> GATE 1: Zoran workshops and approves
  -> builder (own worktree)  <-> tester (bounces fixes back)
  -> GATE 2: Zoran runs the plain-English test script
  -> merge -> back to onboarding
```

Fable plans. Opus builds and tests.

## Prior art: read before proposing anything preset-shaped

- [sales-preset-entity-handoff.md](../bam-ghl-agent/docs/sales-preset-entity-handoff.md) - the plan to make presets ONE shared entity instead of per-academy stamping
- [project_preset_sweep_2026_07_21.md](../bam-ghl-agent/memories/project_preset_sweep_2026_07_21.md) - Zoran's locked preset rules, plus the standing warning not to build preset-shaped work separately
