# Pending SQL - migrations waiting to be applied to prod

**What this is:** the handoff ledger between sessions that WRITE migrations
(often remote/cloud Claude sessions that cannot touch the live DB) and the
session that APPLIES them (Zoran, locally, via the Supabase CLI).

**Zoran: run `/pending-sql` to apply everything listed here.** `/showtime` and
`/start` will nag you when this table is non-empty.

**Authors (any session that adds a migration file without applying it): add a
row here in the same commit as the migration.** Remote sessions can never
apply - always add your row. Rule lives in `bam-portal/CLAUDE.md`.

## ⏳ PENDING

| Migration file | What it does | Blocked features until applied | Added |
|---|---|---|---|
| `20260727150000_conversations_last_author_kind.sql` | `conversations.last_message_author_kind` + trigger update, stamps who sent the last message | Staff Inbox sender prefixes ("You:" / "Mike:") - inbox otherwise fine, API falls back | 2026-07-27 (Cole session, PR #1629) |
