# Member-management KPI + Actions pages (planned) + MRR calculation gotchas

**Status 2026-07-16:** KPI list + mockup approved by Zoran ("those are all the numbers i need"); THIRD left page added: **Actions** (client action items). Build greenlit same day.

**FUTURE SESSION (Zoran, 2026-07-16):** action items will be extended beyond this page - tied into the portal's GENERAL action items system, tied to specific clients AND leads (not just members), with actions you can take on them. Treat the Actions page shipped here as v1/member-scoped; design the data shape so it can join that wider system later.

## The plan

Left pages in the Shield members focus (the roster ↔ contact column shipped in #1464): a **Roster | KPIs | Actions toggle** in the same left column (Actions tab carries an open-count badge). All scoped to the **training offer** (via `members.offer_id`), adjustable time window, default **MTD**. These academies have no parent app, so everything comes from the billing/roster spine - no attendance/engagement data.

Agreed KPI list:

| KPI | Source / note |
|---|---|
| Cancellations (windowed) | `cancellations` table (type=cancel, `cancel_date`) |
| Churn rate | **last full month only** (Zoran's call): cancels ÷ month-start live count |
| New members | `joined_date` in window |
| Avg revenue / member (ARPM) | `_ccMonthly` per live member (fixed, see below) |
| MRR | **status='live' ONLY** (Zoran 2026-07-16: cancelling members are leaving, don't count them); paused excluded; cancelling surfaces as `pendingCancel` in `_ccMemberKpis` |
| Live / paused counts | roster statuses |
| Members per pricing + live vs archived price counts | roster × `pricing_catalog` (tier, `offer_price_key`) |
| Pending cancels | `status='cancelling'` - churn still savable |
| Net growth | new − cancelled |
| MRR movement | +new MRR / −churned MRR in window |
| $ at risk | payment_failed / payment_method_required count + monthly value |
| Paused MRR | parked revenue |
| Avg tenure (months) | best retention proxy without app data |

## Actions page - the action-item catalog (agreed 2026-07-16)

Grouped by urgency; every row = member + issue + $/mo value + one-tap action; tapping the member opens their contact card in the same column; tapping the action has Shield draft it in chat. Sales-side cards (post-trial, booking) stay in Hawkeye - this page is member-side only.

**Money (red, act today):** payment failed (retry / payment link) · no card on file / card expiring before next bill (card-update link) · past-due invoice.
**Leaving (amber, savable):** pending cancel with period-end date + reason (save offer / exit call) · pause ending soon (confirm return) · pause scheduled (prep) · paused past pause_end but not resumed (unpause or cancel).
**Milestones (gold, loyalty):** member anniversaries 1/3/6/12 mo (congrats) · commitment term (3mo/6mo) ending soon (renewal conversation) · new member first week (check-in).
**Hygiene (neutral):** member on archived/legacy price (migrate to live pricing) · uncatalogued Stripe price (fix mapping) · missing agreement/waiver (chase signature) · missing phone/email on contact.
**Win-back (future):** recently cancelled 30-60d ago from `cancellations` (re-engage offer).

## Cancellation snapshots (shipped 2026-07-16)

Cancelled members are DELETED from `members`, so `cancellations` rows now FREEZE the member's economics at cancel time: `joined_date, plan_name, stripe_price_id, offer_id, monthly_amount_cents, total_spent_cents, payments_count, source (staff_portal|parent_app|stripe), involuntary` (Stripe `cancellation_details.reason='payment_failed'` = dunning auto-cancel). Written by BOTH insert sites: `actionCancel` (api/members.js) and `handleSubDeleted` (api/stripe/webhook.js) via shared `api/_runtime/cancellation-snapshot.js`. `members` also carries `total_spent_cents, payments_count, spend_synced_at` refreshed by `GET /api/members?action=spend-sync` (one paginated invoice sweep per account). Historical rows backfilled 2026-07-16 by `scripts/backfill-cancellations.mjs` (21/21 full; join dates taken from EARLIEST PAID INVOICE, not sub start - June-2026 migration subs carry fake start dates).

**Known data-truth gap:** live members' `members.joined_date` still holds the June migration date for most of GTA → active tenure understated + "new members" inflated. Fix = same earliest-invoice correction, but it changes roster/milestones behavior; needs Zoran's go-ahead.

## Gotchas (learned the hard way)

1. **`pricing_catalog.interval` speaks TERM vocabulary**, not raw Stripe intervals: `4_weeks`, `3_months`, `6_months`, `week`, `month`, `year`, `one_time` (see `api/offers/create-price.js` `termToInterval`). Stripe's `interval_count` is baked into the term string and is NOT in the roster payload.
2. **`_ccMonthly` (client-portal.html) is the SINGLE MRR engine** - Shield KPIs, Home dashboard MRR, Hawkeye Mission Control, growth sparklines, ARPU all run through it. Before #1466 it ignored terms: 3-month prices counted 3x over, 6-month 6x over, 4_weeks ~8% under, one_time counted as recurring. Now decodes any `N_unit` term generically (day/week/month/year units, e.g. `2_weeks`, `9_months` work with no code change) + zeroes out one_time/onetime/once. If you add a weirder term shape to `termToInterval`, make sure `_ccMonthly`'s regex still decodes it.
3. **Cancelled members are DELETED from `members`** (immediately, or at period end via the `customer.subscription.deleted` webhook). Churn/cancellation KPIs MUST read the append-only `cancellations` table, never the roster.
4. **`cancellations` rows don't carry `offer_id`** - scoping churn to the training offer needs a join back through `stripe_subscription_id` / `pricing_catalog`.
5. Catalog `hst_mode` mixes `all_in` and `pre_tax`, so MRR/ARPU are tax-inconsistent approximations - keep the "approx" label in the UI.
