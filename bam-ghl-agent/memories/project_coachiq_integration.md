name: CoachIQ integration — billing ownership + credits webhook bridge
description: How BAM GTA's billing is split across CoachIQ/GHL/manual, why the portal can't write to those Stripe subs, and the CONFIRMED webhook bridge (api-v3.coachiq.io Incoming Webhook automation trigger) that lets the portal own billing while CoachIQ keeps granting credits.

# CoachIQ integration

## What CoachIQ is to BAM GTA

CoachIQ is the **credits + scheduling engine** BAM GTA uses. Athletes get
training "credits"; CoachIQ grants them when a CoachIQ product is purchased and
redeems them on booking. The `members.coachiq_member_id` column is the CoachIQ
user id for each athlete.

## Who created BAM GTA's Stripe subscriptions (the `application` stamp)

Every Stripe sub carries an `application` id = the Connect app that created it.
For BAM GTA (`acct_1P7kUCRxInSEtAh8`, a **Standard** connected account):

```
ca_G3zgR3Ix46909q9NDX3KlZjURzBW8TsK = CoachIQ          ~68 subs (the bulk)
ca_D5Mpe2emSMW6EZeofhNaydC4Kq5zGxQo = GoHighLevel       ~9 subs (altId = GHL loc)
NULL                                = Stripe dashboard ~23 subs (manual)
BAM portal                          = 0 subs
```

Live (active+trialing) ≈ 33: CoachIQ 18, manual 13, GHL 2.

## Why the portal can't manage these subs

Standard connected account → the platform can READ everything but can only
WRITE to subs **it created**. The portal created none, so pause/unpause/change/
cancel/referred all fail with *"can't make changes on a subscription that was
not created by your application."* See [[project_stripe_app_created_subs]] for
the full Stripe-side detail. In-place manual edits in Stripe keep the same
sub_id, so CoachIQ stays synced (that's why the Knowl manual pause was correct).

## The CoachIQ API — what the key can do

There are no public API docs. The main app (`admin.coachiq.io`, Apollo GraphQL)
is session-authed + WAF-locked — the API key does NOT open it.

The public API key (org id + group id + key, from CoachIQ Settings → API keys)
works in two places:

1. **Zapier integration** — limited: ACTIONS = Create User, Send Email/SMS/
   In-App/Announcement. TRIGGERS (outbound) = New User/Purchase/Booking/Form.
   No "add credits" action here.
2. **Automation Incoming Webhook trigger** — the useful one (below).

## CONFIRMED: Incoming Webhook automation trigger

CoachIQ automations can be triggered by an inbound webhook (the help docs omit
this, but the product UI has it). Confirmed working live on 2026-06-01.

```
ENDPOINT  POST https://api-v3.coachiq.io/hook/automation/trigger/{automationId}
AUTH      Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>
          x-group-id: <GROUP_ID>
BODY      arbitrary JSON; referenced in automation actions as {{payload.key}}
          (nested {{payload.user.email}}, arrays {{payload.items.0.id}})
```

Auth test results (dummy automationId):
- no header → 401 "Missing Authorization header"
- wrong key → 401 "Invalid API key"
- valid key + x-group-id → 404 "Automation not found" = **auth passed** ✅

Real API host is **api-v3.coachiq.io** (not api.coachiq.io, which doesn't
resolve). DNS → 44.233.29.64.

Automation ACTIONS available (internal): Add/Redeem Credits, Add/Remove Tag,
Add/Remove Product Purchase, Grant/Revoke Program Access, messaging, Wait,
Send to External Webhook (outbound). TRIGGERS: New User, New Purchase, New
Booking, New Form, New/Removed Tag Connection, Booking Created/Started/Ended/
Cancelled/Completed, Subscription Cancelled, Scheduled Check, **Incoming Webhook**.

## The bridge architecture (lets the portal own billing)

```
Portal owns Stripe sub (all buttons work)
  → Stripe payment webhook → portal handler
  → POST api-v3.coachiq.io/hook/automation/trigger/<creditAutomationId>
     Bearer <key> · x-group-id <group>
     { "userId": <members.coachiq_member_id>, "credits": N, "plan": "2/wk" }
  → CoachIQ automation: Incoming Webhook → "Add Credits to {{payload.userId}}"
Pause/cancel → portal simply stops POSTing (or fires a redeem/revoke automation).
```

This decouples credits from CoachIQ's sub_id, so #3 (portal-created new subs) and
#4 (migrate the 33 live subs to portal-owned) both become viable without breaking
credits. Migration card-reuse check: 26/33 have a reusable default PM, 7 need a
re-collect (payment link).

## Secrets

The API key, org id, and group id are NOT stored in this repo. They belong in
Vercel env when the bridge is built. The key Zoran pasted in chat on 2026-06-01
should be rotated.

## Status / next steps (not built yet)

1. Zoran creates ONE CoachIQ automation: Incoming Webhook → Add Credits.
2. Sends the automationId → fire a real test credit at a test athlete.
3. Build: Stripe webhook handler → POST to CoachIQ + pause/cancel logic.
4. Decide scope: bridge for new subs only (#3) vs migrate the 33 live (#4).
